\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the

{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

Team meetings will be held weekly on Tuesdays at 2:00pm at a Hatch conference 
room. However, team meetings are flexible, if a majority of the team (3/4 members) 
agrees to either cancel the weekly meeting, schedule an extra meeting, or hold 
the meeting virtually then the according changes will be made.
\\
\\
\indent Supervisor meetings will be held every 2 weeks on Wednesdays at 3:00pm in JHE 373. Similar to team meetings, if either the supervisor requests 
or a majority of the team agrees to any of the previously stated changes, 
they will be made.
\\
\\
\indent The meeting chair will head meetings and will present the weekly agenda at 
the beginning of each meeting which will cover the topics to be discussed. 
Each team member will provide a weekly summary covering the work they've 
done and outstanding issues they've been tackling. Discussion of these 
weekly agenda items and outstanding issues will be lead by the meeting 
chair. Every team member will leave the meeting with a list of TODO items 
that they plan to tackle next. The agenda, weekly summaries, outstanding 
issues, decisions made and TODOs will be recorded by the scribe in the 
meeting's assigned Github issue. Finally, meetings have a maximum duration of
1 hour.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\indent GitHub issues will be used to communicate technical information 
between group members.
\\
\\
\indent Discord will be used as the main group communication channel for the team. A majority 
of group communication will be held through here including online meetings, admin details, 
and general unplanned discussions. 
\\
\\
\indent Call and Text will be used for direct communication between 2 team members
and will generally be resereved for high priority and urgent communcation or 
campus location coordination. 

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Jung Woo Lee
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Scrum Master
	  \item Developer
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

Git is the most important part in managing issues, editing documentation, and developing features.
Before any changes should be made, a "git pull" should be entered into the Github capstone directory
for updating the local repository to the latest changes on the remote branch.
Once this is complete, a branch should be created, from the main branch, for any commits involving
documentation, development code, or any other changes present within the repository.
With these commits, there should be comments detailing the changes that have been made.
Furthermore, each commit should have the designated code name associated with it.
After these commits are tested, committed, and then pushed from the local to the remote repository,
a pull request should be made to merge the branch commit to the main branch. 
At least one approval will be required from a reviewer for each pull request
to be merged with the main branch. Finally, when the commits have been successfully
merged to the main branch, the branch the commits were made on will be deleted.
\\
\\
\indent For managing merge conflicts, the developer should identify the conflicting changes,
making sure to resolve any conflicts before new changes are made. Once all conflicts
are resolved, the developer should be able to proceed in testing, committing, and pushing
their changes to the remote repository.

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\subitem The project can roughly be divided into 3 main components:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A database where the bulk of the site's data will be stored.
  \item A webserver which will host the website's visual data and code.
  \item Middleware which will allow for communication between the 
  webserver and database.
\end{enumerate}
\subitem The middleware will be written in Python due to its ease of use and 
familiarity among team members.
\subitem We will either use PostgreSQL scripts or an ORM (like SQLalchemy) 
to implement the database, the language used will depend on the implementation 
chosen. PostgreSQL scripts would require using only SQL, while an ORM would 
likely live where with middleware and as such would be written in Python.
\subitem The webserver will be written in Javascript using the React framework.
This is because of its ease of use, team member experience, and large set 
of available libraries which will be useful for implementing the visual elements
of the website. Additionally, it was expressed to us by stakeholders that the 
website should be easily maintainable. Implementing the website using an 
extremely popular and widespread framework such as React means that there 
are countless resources online to help future maintainers keep the project alive.

\item Specific libraries
\subitem Depending on the implementation, the middleware will use some combination
of the FastAPI and SQLalchemy libraries. FastAPI will be used to implement HTTPS 
commmunication rotuers between the database and webserver. SQLalchemy will be used to 
implement the database if it is decided that it will be implemented using an ORM.
\subitem The webserver will use a large set of both funcational and visual react
libraries. For example react-navigation will be used for its page traversal 
functionality while libraries such as react-datepicker and react-calendar will 
be very helpful in implement the visual elements of a scheduling system. 
Additionally, the axios library will be used to form and send the HTTPS requests 
to the middleware from the webserver.
\item Pre-trained models
\subitem This project does not include an AI component and will not use 
a machine learning model.
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\subitem ESLint will be used for linting Javascript code while flake8 will be 
used to lint Python code. We chose these linters due to our previous experience 
using them and because they provide our preferred formatting style.
\item Specific unit testing framework
\subitem The pytest framework will be used to create unit tests for the middleware
code. We chose pytest over other python testing frameworks due to its simplicity, 
small amount of boilerplate code, and plugins which can add useful functionalities
like coverage reporting. We plan to incorporate these pytest unit tests as a part
of our CI plans for the project via Github actions.
\subitem Testing the database will likely be done using a dummy / development 
PostgreSQL database prior to making any changes to the production database to 
ensure that minimal migrations are required during development.
\subitem Our plans for testing our webserver's React code are not decided yet, 
but we're currently investigating potential testing options.
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\subitem The Coverage.py Python library will be used to measure the code coverage
of our middleware program. For the webserver's React code, Jest is included by 
default when using the "create-react-app" command and will be used to measure 
the code coverage of the webserver.
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\subitem lighthouse for react, cProfile included with python
\subitem The webserver will be hosted on azure's web app services, meaning that
azure's suite of performance measrement tools and metrics will be used as the 
webserver's main performance measurement system. Additionally, we plan to do
practical performance tests with stakeholders by having them use the website 
casually to ensure that performance during regular use is up to their standards 
/ expectations.
\subitem Similarly, the database will be hosted on an azure container, meaning 
that azure's suite of performance meaurement tools and metrics will once again 
be used as the databases main performance measurement system. Additionally, 
performance of queries will be timed throughout development to determine what 
indices should exist on the database for practical performance.
\subitem Finally, the middleware will use the profile library included with 
Python to measure the performance of its HTTPS routes.
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\subitem There are a number of tools/programs/services that we plan to use that 
were either mentioned in passing previously or not mentioned at at all.
\subitem Azure containers and/or virtual machines will be used to host both the 
database and middleware components of this project. Additionally, the webserver 
will be hosted using azure's web app services. This allows all main components 
of the project to be hosted in one place.
\subitem Node.js will be the server environment which we run our webserver on 
and npm will be what we use to manage our Javascript 
packages.
\subitem Git/GitHub will be used for version control on the project. GitHub 
projects will be used as a general project management tool to help keep 
track of issues, work done, and available tasks. Finally, GitHub actions will 
be used for CI of tests as the repository is modified.
\end{itemize}
