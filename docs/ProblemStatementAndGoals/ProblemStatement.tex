\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Background}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

The McMaster GSA softball league is used every summer by 30-40 teams and
as many as 1,000 unique participants. The league is currently organized through
an old software platform accessible via a web browser, but it is outdated and
does not include features for administrators to maintain the site without
extensive knowledge of computer programming.

\subsection{Problem}

\indent \indent The GSA league is aware that paid-for and ad-supported services are available,
and features present in those applications should be explored and added if
possible. The GSA league is a minimal-cost non-profit and would like a
personalized platform by which to operate without committing to paid-for
services. The platform will be responsible for including all functionalities
such as scheduling, division management, communication between captains, waiver
management, rescheduling, score and league standings management, and other
tasks identified by the stakeholders. The platform would be a web-based service
with the same functionalities, but in an updated form that also enables league
and schedule management from a convenient user interface
(specific access privileges for team representatives and league administrators).

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\subsubsection{Inputs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Player/Captain/Commissioner login information
    \item Player/Captain/Commissioner contact information
    \item Team name
    \item Game score
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Outputs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item League standings
    \item League scheduling
\end{itemize}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The supervisor of the project, Dr. Jake Nease
    \item Captains and players of the softball league
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment}

\begin{description}
    \item [Software] Windows, Linux or Mac OS
    \item [Hardware] Computers with access to the internet
\end{description}

\section{Goals}

\begin{description}
    \item [Accomplish everything the existing league website does]
    The current website allows captains to log in and record their matches
    and scores. It allows scheduling and rescheduling, and provides a place
    to see the league rules, parking information and other information. The
    current website often breaks, requiring the current website admin to fix
    issues as they arise. First and foremost we need to recreate the original
    league website functionality.
    \item [User interface should be intuitive to all users.] The current
    interface is unintuiative and awkward to use. Users should understand
    how to log in and how to view their schedule just by looking at their
    homepage. No external information should be required.
    \item [Allow players to make accounts] Currently, only captains have
    accounts in the system. Player accounts should only be able to view the
    contact information of their team captain, captains should only be able
    to view the contact of their players and other captains, and commisioners
    should be able to see everything.
    \item [Matches should be able to be scheduled and rescheduled.] 
    Team captains should be able to give their team's availablity and the
    software will algorithmically schedule the season's matches. If a team
    isn't available for a match after it has been scheduled, captains can
    send a reschedule request with a selection of possible alternative times
    that the opposition team's captain can agree to.
    \item [Commisioners should be able to notify captains with information]
    Commisioner level accounts should be able to easily send out a
    notification to specific users or entire groups of users, such as all
    captains or all players. The information in the notification should be
    customizable by the commisioner.
\end{description}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\begin{description}
    \item [Commisioners should be able to "rain out" matches] After a match
    has been scheduled, commisioner level accounts should be able to force
    a reschedule if the weather makes the game unreasonable to play. This
    will send a notification to the two team captains so they can
    choose a date that works.
    \item [League template saving] A season's teams and players should be
    able to be saved as a template that can be loaded the next season. This
    is useful as many teams remain the same or similar between seasons, and
    it would be convienient for all returning teams to avoid reinviting all
    returning players.
    \item [A mobile application companion] Users would be able to perform
    some actions they can on the website, like viewing schedules and
    standings.
\end{description}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
\end{enumerate}  

\subsection*{Reflection -- Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba}

Majority of the deliverable went well resulting from the information
the team had received in our initial meeting with the supervisor of the
project, Dr. Jake Nease. He was able to detail many of the expectations
he had relating to the information required for the deliverable such as
the inputs, outputs, stakeholders, and goals. Only minimal brainstorming
was required from the team to fill in the rest of the information for the
deliverable. \newline

Certain pain points the team did experience, while writing this deliverable,
related to the problem the project would be addressing. Although some of
the information was gathered from the project description, which was listed
in the potential project document, provided to students, the team
still needed to address other crucial information that may not have
initially come to mind. This was resolved from the collective effort of
the team, brainstorming further resolutions as to why this problem needs
our specific solution. \newline

The team was able to adjust the scope of the goals, based on complexity,
by separating the primary goals of the project with the stretch goals.
Goals such as replicating the current features the exisiting website
possesses, having an easy-to-use interface, and a login system, make sure
the Capstone project isn't too overly ambitious and definitely achievable.
The stretch goals help to add complexity to create a senior design project
as developing a mobile version of the system and other additional features
are extra add-ons that add to the bulk of the work needed to be completed.
